# Documentation Guide — Consistency and Approval Workflow

Version: 0.11.0-approved | Date: 2026-09-21

## 1. Scope
- Create and maintain `.md` files only. No code generation.
- Existing file `student-ai-super-app-complete-feature-list.md` is read-only unless user explicitly approves a change.

## 2. Approval Workflow
1. Present proposed changes with reasons. Reference affected vision sections.
2. Record proposals in `FEATURE-GAPS.md` as Proposals only.
3. Wait for explicit user approval stating what is approved.
4. After approval, update the relevant `.md` files and bump version and date.
5. If proposal is rejected, mark it as Declined with date, do not apply.

## 3. Consistency Rules
- Use vision list section numbers when referencing features (for example, Section 2.4).
- Use term `date-specific exception` for one-day timetable changes, and `weekly template` for recurring timetable.
- Preserve attendance rule: cancelled and holidays never count as absences. Attendance is self-marked only. No faculty verification.
- Student-only rule: no college staff login. Reviewer and admin are internal ops, not college staff. Faculty names are display-only in timetable.
- PRD-MVP, ARCHITECTURE-PLAN, DATA-MODEL-SPEC, ROADMAP, SUPABASE-PLAN must agree on MVP scope. If one changes, update the others in the same approval batch. COMPLIANCE-DPDP.md is authoritative for DPDP duties.
- Each doc header carries Version, Date, Status.

## 4. File Ownership
- `README.md`: index, no feature details.
- `PRD-MVP.md`: what MVP includes and acceptance checks.
- `FEATURE-GAPS.md`: why new items are needed, what would change.
- `ARCHITECTURE-PLAN.md`: module boundaries and non-functional needs.
- `DATA-MODEL-SPEC.md`: entities and integrity rules.
- `ROADMAP.md`: phasing and dependencies, including Phase 0 Supabase setup.
- `SUPABASE-PLAN.md`: backend choice, service mapping, buckets, access principles. Spec only, no code.
- `COMPLIANCE-DPDP.md`: DPDP duties summary. Spec only, not legal advice.
- `FOUNDER-STARTUP-GAPS.md`: startup gaps beyond product. Spec only.
